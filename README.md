# Papers-Notes

This repository contains my paper and posts reading notes on deep learning and machine learning, mainly focused on my thesis "Deep Learning based Multi-Object Tracking, Sensor Fusion and Motion Forecasting for Intelligent Vehicles applications".

*New year resolution for 2021: read at least three paper a week and a high a high quality github repo a month!*
